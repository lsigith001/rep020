# Creating a static class with no instances

# That is, the Pythonic way would be:

# My module
elements = []

def add_element(x):
  elements.append(x)

# But if you want to mirror the structure of Java, you can do:

# My module
class World(object):
    elements = []
    @staticmethod
    def add_element(x):
        World.elements.append(x)


# You can also do this with @classmethod if you care to know the specific class (which can be handy if you want
# to allow the static method to be inherited by a class inheriting from this class):
#
#  My module
class World(object):
    elements = []
    @classmethod
    def add_element(cls, x):
        cls.elements.append(x)
